Hotel Booking Cancellation

Situation: A prestigious 5-star hotel is facing losses due to sudden customer booking cancellations, preventing other potential guests from staying. They've enlisted a Data Scientist with machine learning skills to predict and minimize such cancellations.

Task: Develop a machine learning model to predict customer booking cancellations. Create an effective solution to reduce losses caused by last-minute cancellations.

Action: I employed a variety of machine learning algorithms, feature engineering, and model selection techniques to build a predictive model. My work involved thorough data analysis and predictive modeling to achieve accurate cancellation predictions. I had to work on understanding patterns that differentiate customers who cancel from those who don't.

Result: Through this project, I demonstrated my expertise in machine learning, data-driven decision-making, and predictive modeling. The model we developed allows the hotel to predict the likelihood of a customer canceling a booking, enabling them to allocate rooms more effectively and reduce losses. We evaluated the model's performance based on metrics such as True Positives and True Negatives, and the impact is twofold: maximizing profits by filling all rooms and minimizing the loss of potential customers.

This project aligns with the hotel's goal of predicting customer behavior, ensuring that rooms are allocated to customers who are less likely to cancel their bookings, ultimately contributing to a more profitable and efficient operation.
